# practice-3
In the practical work I created a calculator class that performs calculations according to a specific formula. 
Class `SimpleCalculator` has two methods:
- `compute()` - determines the result of the function according to the value `x` given in the parameters.
- `step_compute()` - determines the result for the interval from `x1` to `x2`.
